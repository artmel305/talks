        <b>Ginni 2.0:</b> Hi Art! It's nice to meet you.  You can call me Ginni. While I am trained by Google and based on the Gemini family of models, you can think of me as Ginni 2.0 Advanced Experimental for our conversation today.  It's January 19, 2025, in our little world here.

What can I help you with on this fine (fictional) January day?
